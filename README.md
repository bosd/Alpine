# Acknoledgement
**Special thanks to [u/j_oshreve](https://www.reddit.com/user/j_oshreve/) on Reddit** for all his work on https://github.com/joshreve/dactyl-keyboard. Without all his is doing this project would not have been possible. 

I would note this repo would gave me a great guide to get to a working product. https://github.com/OutstandingOof/ducktyl-manuform
